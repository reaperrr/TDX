MOD:
Just make sure the "tdx" folder containing this and the other files is located in or copied to the /mods/ subfolder of your OpenRA installation directory.
If the folder structure matches the official OpenRA mods ("E:/OpenRA/mods/tdx", for example), you should be good to go.

CONTENT:
TDX uses the base content from C&C1, so when prompted to do so, you can choose either Download or from CD, though Download is recommended due to speed and potential mod incompatibilities with non-english C&C CDs.

MUSIC:
Ignore the 'from CD' option, TDX uses stereo versions of several C&C tracks, always choose 'Download'.
