MOD:
>>>
IMPORTANT!
> If you previously downloaded and installed the original release 0.50, delete it from the 'mods' subfolder located in OpenRA's installation directory before proceeding!
> Otherwise newer versions of TDX will NOT work properly (or at all)!

Installation from version 0.51 onwards works as follows:
1. Go to your systems' "My Documents\OpenRA" or equivalent (MacOSX: ~/Library/Application Support/OpenRA/ --- Linux: ~/.openra/)
2. Check if there is a 'mods' subfolder amongst the other OpenRA system folders (maps, Replays etc.). If yes, skip 3. and proceed with 4.
3. Create a new 'mods' folder.
4. Copy tdx.oramod into that folder. Overwrite any older tdx.oramod, if present.
5. Launch the game. If TDX can be selected and loads successfully, you're done.

CONTENT:
TDX uses the base content from C&C1, so when prompted to do so, you can choose either Download or from CD, though Download is recommended due to speed and potential mod incompatibilities with non-english C&C CDs.

MUSIC:
Ignore the 'from CD' option, TDX uses stereo versions of several C&C tracks, always choose 'Download'.
